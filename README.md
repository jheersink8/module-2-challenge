# Jordan Heersink Portfolio

## Description

Website URL (https://jheersink8.github.io/module-2-challenge/)

This website is designed to showcase some of my (Jordan Heersink's) projects while I'm progressing through DU's full-stack bootcamp. This website was initially built in December of 2023 and it will be added to as more content becomes available. 

- **What was your motivation?** At the time of writing this readme, I have a little more than two weeks of experience using HTML/CSS tools. As I practice and get more comfortable using them, I'm finding myself in a situation where I want to showcase what I can do. This website is designed to be a centralized collection of my projects. 
- **Why did you build this project?** One of my main goals in learning these concepts is to possibly engage in a career shift. I wanted to build a professional website (with my current skill set) that will show future employers what I'm capable of. 
- **What problem does it solve?** Similar to the last point, this website will help make me more marketable. By having some of my project highlights centralized, it will make showcasing the content that much easier for future employers. 
- **What did you learn?** This has been my biggest learning project so far. The biggest lesson learned is that transitions and animations (while aesthetically pleasing) are very time consuming to create. I'm happy with my end result, but it took a lot of effort to get to that point. This was also the first project I've worked on where I was able to employ about 90% of all the concepts that we have learned in class thus far. It was a good learning experience to see them all work in tandem to create a single cohesive page. 

## Usage
This page is meant to serve as a "digital resume." Simply scroll through the page to see my brief bio, view some of my projects, or look at my contact info. Below is a screenshot of the final product. 

Some features of this page include: 
- CSS transitions and animations
- Links to external sources (LinkedIn, Github, etc.)
- A responsive layout for mobile and tablet devices 
- The use of variables for ease of changing page themes and styles
