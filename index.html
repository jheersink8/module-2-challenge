            My name is Jordan Heersink and I have a strong passion for all things related to
            technology. When I was a kid, I had a fascination with what makes computers work, how they can be used to make our lives easier,
            and even building computers from scratch. On a professional level, I have the opportunity to bolster my
            proclivity towards technology by serving as a manager for a university technology support team!
            </p></br><p>
            A large portion of my professional experience in the IT field has consisted of communicating end user
            requests to a development team. While I do enjoy playing the role as a liaison between the end user and the
            developers, I wanted to sharpen my skill set and learn how to do the same projects that the development team
            has done for me. Below is a portfolio that showcases some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on in my journey
            to learn more. Please check back regularly for added content!</p></article>
